# COSGCGroundStation
CU Colorado Space Grant Ground Station Code Repository

Notes
- Ground station weather automation can be implemented way better than it was last semester
- I think the issue with the dde may be in the DivOptions folder for satpc32. Try copying this file from the old ground stations and pasting in the new ground station and see if it fixes my issue.
